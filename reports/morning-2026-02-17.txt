Perfect. Now I'll generate the morning briefing for sir:

---

Good morning, sir. JARVIS daily briefing for 2026-02-17.

SYSTEMS STATUS:
- Orchestrator: master branch, 2 files modified (scripts/morning-report.sh, scripts/orchestrator.sh), 2 report files untracked
- Workspaces: 73 registered (26 VisionKing, 46 SpotFusion, 18 DieMaster, 14 SDK)

HIGH-PRIORITY ITEMS:
- VisionKing: SEC-01 (Rotate hardcoded credentials), TEST-01 (Python test suites), TEST-02 (C++ test infrastructure)
- DieMaster: SEC-01 (Remove hardcoded credentials), SEC-02 (Remove eval() code execution), FW-01 (Stabilize firmware)

RECENT ACTIVITY:
- 21470cf feat: add JARVIS morning briefing cron with Telegram notification
- 6fddc4d feat: add /jarvis skill for JARVIS persona and orchestrator context
- eba4506 chore: update all paths from claude-orchestrator to JARVIS

Security concerns flagged: Both VisionKing and DieMaster have hardcoded credentials and secrets in repositories. Immediate remediation recommended before next deployment cycle.

Ready when you are, sir.
