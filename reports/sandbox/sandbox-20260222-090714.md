# Sandbox Report: sandbox/20260222-090714

**Date:** 2026-02-22 09:14<br>
**Task:** Implement Phase 1 of the Meeting Assistant MCP server. Scope: (1) Scaffold the MCP server at mcp-servers/meeting-assistant/ with package.json, tsconfig.json, and TypeScript source. (2) Implement Google Docs bridge (gdoc-bridge.ts) using the googleapis npm package directly — create, read, update Google Docs in the 'Meeting Assistant' folder inside the JARVIS Shared Drive (Drive ID: 0AC4RjZu6DAzcUk9PVA). Use the same service account pattern as mcp-servers/google-workspace/index.js (JWT auth with domain-wide delegation, impersonating pedro@lumesolutions.com, credentials at config/credentials/gcp-service-account.json). (3) Implement transcript accumulator (transcript.ts) — stores timestamped lines with speaker labels. (4) Implement the live notes update engine (live-notes.ts) — every ~30s reads full Google Doc, reads new transcript, calls claude --print to update notes, writes back to doc. (5) Create inject_transcript MCP tool for testing without audio — accepts text + speaker and appends to accumulator. (6) Create start_meeting and stop_meeting MCP tools. start_meeting creates a new Google Doc and begins the update cycle. stop_meeting halts the cycle. (7) Create config/meeting-assistant.json with the live_notes section from the spec. (8) Create the /meeting skill at .claude/skills/meeting/SKILL.md. (9) Language detection is a placeholder — store detected_language in session state, default to 'auto'. Do NOT implement audio capture or STT in this phase — those come later. The inject_transcript tool is the only input mechanism for Phase 1.<br>
