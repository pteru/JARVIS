## New Skills / MCP Servers

### ClickUp Connector
- **Status:** Idea
- **Description:** Integrate with ClickUp using their official MCP Server to sync tasks, backlogs, and status updates between the orchestrator and ClickUp workspaces.
- **Notes:** Details TBD. Start by evaluating the official ClickUp MCP Server capabilities and mapping them to orchestrator concepts (backlogs, workspaces, priorities).

### Changelog Reviewer
- **Status:** Idea
- **Description:** A skill that reads pending changelog entries and generates a structured report showing how the changes should be organized into branches and commits. The report must be reviewed and explicitly authorized by the user before any changes are deployed.
- **Notes:** Acts as a gate between "changes recorded" and "changes deployed". Should output a proposed branching/commit strategy in a human-readable format for approval.
