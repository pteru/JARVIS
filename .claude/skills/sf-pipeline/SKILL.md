description: Explain the SpotFusion pipeline architecture
---

Explain the SpotFusion pipeline architecture. Read architecture files from `/home/teruel/JARVIS/workspaces/strokmatic/spotfusion/architecture/` and the context at `.claude/context.md`. Describe the data flow from smart cameras through detection, the fan-out pattern (N spots × M classifiers), aggregation, and database writing. Highlight the key architectural difference from VisionKing (fan-out vs linear pipeline).
