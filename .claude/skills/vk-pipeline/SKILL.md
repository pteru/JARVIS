description: Explain the VisionKing pipeline architecture

Explain the VisionKing pipeline architecture. Read `architecture/pipeline.mmd` and `architecture/pipeline.md` from the visionking workspace at `/home/teruel/JARVIS/workspaces/strokmatic/visionking/`. Describe the data flow from cameras through inference to database, including the two routing paths (with and without 3D projection via pixel-to-object). Reference the `.claude/context.md` for queue names and Redis keyspace details.
